## 🎮 What is this?

> *"Tired of fancy graphics? Me too."*

This is **Terminal Snake** - a classic snake game that runs entirely in your terminal. No Electron apps, no bloated frameworks, no GPU required (not even integrated). Just good old-fashioned ASCII art and Python magic.
Runs on a toaster. Seriously.

Built as a fun experiment to explore **TUI (Terminal User Interface)** development using the awesome [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/) framework. Because why use a mouse when you have arrow keys?

- ⏸️ **Pause Functionality** - For when your boss walks by
- 🎯 **Score Tracking** - Bragging rights included
- 🔄 **Restart Without Quitting** - Because "just one more game"
- ⚡ **Electron apps hate this one weird trick**

## 🛠️ Built With

- **[Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/)** - The TUI framework that makes terminal apps look good
- **[Rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/)** - For those fancy colors and formatting
- **Python** - Because we're not savages writing this in bash

---

## 🧪 Why This Exists

> *"I wanted to play Snake but my browser was busy mining cryptocurrency..."*  
> — A Developer, Probably

This project was born from:
- Boredom
- Curiosity about TUI frameworks
- To prove that terminals can look fancy too
- The desire to prove that 2026's coolest games don't need a GPU (or a CPU from this decade)

## 🎓 Pro Tips

1. **Don't rage quit** - The terminal remembers
2. **Use WASD if you're a gamer** - Arrow keys are for casuals
3. **Run it in fullscreen terminal** - It's more immersive
4. **Tell your friends** - Then watch them judge your life choices
